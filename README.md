# Narcisist

## Purpose
Narcisist is a web-based application that utilizes multiple APIs to deliver vanity information based on a user's birth-date and name input. Future plans for this application include a user-specific dashboard, horoscope, and horoscope-based compatibility information.

### Using This Code

To customize your own application, swap your own Firebase project in the config.js file. Do note that you'll also need to update your project's authentication settings to match those used by the application, or change the appilcation settings to suit your needs.

### APIs Utilized

1. [Today in History](http://history.muffinlabs.com/ "Today in History")
2. [Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/ "Words API")
3. [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/ "Numbers API")

### Other Technologies Used

1. [Firebase (Google)](https://firebase.google.com/ "Firebase (Google)") - For authentication and database storage.
2. [CORS Everywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/ "CORS Everywhere") - To resolve CORS issues.

### Issues
